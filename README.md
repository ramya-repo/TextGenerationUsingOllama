## Creating HTML Templates
#### To create a user interface, you need to set up HTML templates. In the same directory as app.py, create a folder named templates. Refer: index.html and result.html.

## Running Your Flask Application
#### python app.py

#### Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see your front end in action. You should now have a basic web interface where you can input text and receive a summary generated by your Python script.
